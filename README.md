# School_District_Analysis
## Summary
Based on the data examined from the CSV file, we can arrive at the following conclusions:

1. The inclusion or exclusion of math and reading scores for 9th graders has no meaningful impact on the School District's performance.
2. If the analysis had focused on comparing math and reading data with other schools using statistical analysis, it would have been possible to see where the schools need assistance with.
3. Small and medium-sized schools appear to perform better in terms of Overall Passing Scores. Large schools with over 2000 students underperform when compared to medium and small groups. There are exceptions to the norm, and data demonstrates that a large institution, such as Dixon High School, can achieve high Overall Grades despite its size.
4. In relation to the type of school, we can see that Charter schools fare way better than Public schools.

From the data analyzed, it can be concluded that the schools that perfomed the best are Charter Schools and of Medium or Small size.
